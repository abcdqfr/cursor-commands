# arsenal-separation-of-concerns

Perform comprehensive and exhaustive separation of concerns analysis on the command arsenal to identify semantic overlaps, evaluate contextual strengths, and programmatically define the "best" arsenal structure.

1. **Catalog all commands** - List every command with its purpose, category, and key capabilities
2. **Extract semantic meaning** - Analyze what each command actually does (not just what it says it does)
3. **Identify semantic overlaps** - Find commands that address similar problems or have overlapping functionality
4. **Map contextual strengths** - For each overlap, determine:
   - What unique context does each command provide?
   - What specific use cases does each excel at?
   - What are the distinguishing factors?
5. **Evaluate coexistence justification** - Determine if overlaps are justified:
   - **Justified:** Different contexts, different layers, complementary purposes
   - **Unjustified:** True redundancy, should be merged or removed
6. **Analyze building blocks** - Decompose commands into atomic components:
   - Numbered steps structure
   - Focus areas
   - Consider both sections
   - Format requirements
   - Vernacular patterns
7. **Define optimal structure** - Programmatically determine:
   - Ideal command granularity
   - Optimal category organization
   - Best semantic boundaries
   - Preferred vernacular patterns
8. **Generate recommendations** - Provide actionable improvements:
   - Commands to merge
   - Commands to split
   - Commands to enhance
   - Structural improvements

Focus on:
- **Semantic analysis** - What commands actually do, not just their names
- **Contextual differentiation** - When to use which command
- **Building block patterns** - Common structures across commands
- **Vernacular consistency** - Language patterns and terminology
- **Granularity optimization** - Right-sized commands (not too broad, not too narrow)
- **Category boundaries** - Logical grouping and separation

Consider both:
- **Functional overlap** (do they do the same thing?)
- **Contextual difference** (do they excel in different situations?)

Format analysis as:
- **Command catalog** - Complete list with semantic meaning
- **Overlap matrix** - Commands that overlap, with overlap type
- **Contextual strengths** - What makes each command unique
- **Coexistence justification** - Justified/Unjustified with rationale
- **Building block analysis** - Common patterns, structures, vernacular
- **Optimal structure definition** - Programmatic rules for "best" arsenal
- **Recommendations** - Specific actions (merge, split, enhance, reorganize)

**Semantic Overlap Types:**
- **Exact duplicate** - Same purpose, same approach (should merge)
- **Contextual variant** - Same core, different context (justified if contexts are distinct)
- **Layer difference** - Same problem, different layer (complementary)
- **Scope difference** - Same domain, different granularity (may need split/merge)
- **Approach difference** - Same goal, different method (may be alternatives)

**Building Block Analysis:**
- Step structure patterns (numbered, bulleted, hierarchical)
- Focus area patterns (categories, themes, concerns)
- Consider both patterns (perspectives, trade-offs)
- Format requirements (output structure, citation style)
- Vernacular patterns (terminology, tone, style)

**Optimal Structure Criteria:**
- Single responsibility per command
- Clear semantic boundaries
- Minimal overlap (only when contextually justified)
- Consistent building blocks
- Predictable vernacular
- Logical category organization

Provide exhaustive analysis that programmatically defines the optimal command arsenal structure.
