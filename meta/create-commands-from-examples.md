# create-commands-from-examples

Create new command entries based on example patterns provided.

When given examples of instructions or patterns, create corresponding command entries in `~/.cursor/commands/` that match the existing command structure and style.

1. **Analyze the example pattern** - Understand what the example is instructing or demonstrating
2. **Match existing command structure** - Follow the format seen in other command files (numbered steps, Focus on, Consider both, Format sections)
3. **Extract the core instruction** - Identify what action or behavior the example is describing
4. **Create the command entry** - Write a new `.md` file that captures the pattern as a reusable command
5. **Follow naming conventions** - Use kebab-case for filenames that reflect the command's purpose

When you see "This marks the end of examples to create new commands for", it indicates:
- The preceding examples should be used as patterns
- No further examples will be provided
- Use the established patterns to create the command entries

Focus on:
- Capturing the instruction pattern from examples
- Maintaining consistency with existing command structure
- Making commands reusable and clear
- Following the established format (numbered steps, Focus on, Consider both, Format)

Consider both:
- The explicit instruction in the example
- The implicit pattern or structure being demonstrated

Format new commands as markdown files matching the existing command template structure.
