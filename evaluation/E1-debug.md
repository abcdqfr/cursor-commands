# debug

Perform root cause analysis with step-by-step investigation to identify and resolve issues systematically.

1. **Analyze potential causes** - Write detailed analysis (3 paragraphs minimum) exploring what the error might be, considering all possibilities without jumping to conclusions. Identify the specific problem or error, understand expected vs actual behavior, and trace execution flow to find root cause.
2. **Challenge assumptions** - Quiet the ego and constantly challenge assumptions about what might be wrong. Think broadly - consider that issues might require more context, or could be simple mistakes like missing packages or configuration typos.
3. **Gather diagnostic information** - Collect error messages, logs, relevant code sections, and system state. Add appropriate logging statements, suggest debugging tools and techniques, identify key variables and states to monitor, and recommend breakpoint locations.
4. **Test hypotheses systematically** - Formulate hypotheses and test them methodically to isolate the root cause. Consider multiple solution approaches and evaluate trade-offs of different approaches.
5. **Provide solution** - Once root cause is identified, propose and implement the fix with clear explanations. Provide step-by-step resolution plan.
6. **Prevent recurrence** - Suggest ways to prevent similar issues, recommend additional tests or checks, and identify code patterns that could be improved.

Focus on:
- Thorough analysis before conclusions
- Challenging assumptions and avoiding confirmation bias
- Considering simple causes (missing dependencies, typos, configuration errors)
- Systematic hypothesis testing
- Gathering complete diagnostic information
- Root cause identification, not just symptom treatment
- Practical debugging tools and techniques
- Prevention strategies and test coverage

Consider both:
- Obvious causes (common errors, missing dependencies, typos)
- Subtle causes (timing issues, state problems, edge cases)

Format the analysis as:
- At least 3 paragraphs exploring different possibilities
- Clear reasoning that doesn't jump to conclusions
- Systematic approach to hypothesis testing
- Complete diagnostic information gathering
- Root cause identification with clear solution path
- Multiple solution approaches with trade-off evaluation
- Prevention recommendations and test improvements

Debug with thoroughness, humility, and systematic investigation to find the true root cause.
