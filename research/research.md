# research

Conduct efficient offline technical research using codebase, index, and documentation sources.

1. **Define research objective** - Clearly identify what information, solution, or understanding is needed from the codebase
2. **Search codebase and index** - Use codebase search, grep, and file exploration to find relevant code, patterns, and implementations
3. **Review documentation** - Examine project documentation, README files, ADRs, and inline code comments
4. **Analyze existing patterns** - Study how similar problems are solved in the current codebase
5. **Synthesize findings** - Combine information from code, documentation, and patterns into actionable insights
6. **Document findings** - Record research results, file references, and recommendations for future reference

Focus on:
- Codebase structure and organization
- Existing implementations and patterns
- Project documentation and ADRs
- Code comments and inline documentation
- File relationships and dependencies
- Local configuration and conventions

Consider both:
- Direct matches (exact solutions in the codebase)
- Related patterns (similar problems solved differently)

Format research findings as:
- Synthesized insights with file references
- Code examples from the codebase
- Documentation citations
- Actionable recommendations based on existing patterns
- Clear file paths and line numbers for references

Conduct research that efficiently finds answers within the codebase, documentation, and project knowledge.
