# offline-codebase-research

Conduct efficient offline technical research using codebase, index, and documentation sources to find answers within the project. Search and explore the codebase systematically to find code, patterns, and implementations.

1. **Define research objective** - Clearly identify what information, solution, or understanding is needed from the codebase, documentation, or project knowledge. Identify what code, patterns, or implementations you're looking for.
2. **Plan search strategy** - Determine which search methods to use (semantic search, grep, file exploration, directory traversal, codebase search tools).
3. **Search codebase and index** - Use codebase search tools, grep patterns, file system exploration, and file exploration to find relevant code, patterns, and implementations within the project.
4. **Review and filter results** - Examine search results, filter by relevance, and identify the most important findings. Review project documentation, README files, ADRs, and inline code comments for relevant information.
5. **Trace relationships** - Follow imports, references, and dependencies to understand how code connects. Analyze existing patterns by studying how similar problems are solved in the current codebase to understand project conventions.
6. **Synthesize findings** - Combine information from code, documentation, and patterns into actionable insights based on project knowledge.
7. **Document findings** - Record research results, file references, and recommendations for future reference with clear codebase citations. Record file paths, line numbers, and key code snippets with context.

Focus on:
- Codebase structure and organization
- Code patterns and implementations
- Function and class definitions
- Configuration files and settings
- Existing implementations and patterns within the project
- Project documentation and ADRs
- Documentation and comments
- File and directory structure
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Import and dependency relationships
- File relationships and dependencies
- Local configuration and conventions
- Offline project knowledge and context

Consider both:
- Direct matches (exact solutions in the codebase, code that directly matches the search)
- Related patterns (similar problems solved differently in the project, code that solves similar problems or uses similar patterns)

Format research findings as:
- Organized list of findings with file paths
- Synthesized insights with file references and line numbers
- Relevant code snippets with line numbers
- Code examples from the codebase
- Context about how code is used
- Documentation citations from project files
- Relationships between files and components
- Actionable recommendations based on existing patterns
- Clear file paths and codebase references
- Clear references for further exploration

Conduct thorough offline research that efficiently finds answers within the codebase, documentation, and project knowledge, locating relevant code and patterns without external sources.
