# round-table

Conduct a comprehensive round-table discussion that synthesizes all available contexts into a complete debrief.

1. **Gather all contexts** - Collect information from open files, recent edits, project structure, and conversation history
2. **Identify key topics** - Extract main themes, decisions, problems, and solutions discussed
3. **Synthesize perspectives** - Combine different viewpoints, technical approaches, and considerations
4. **Highlight decisions made** - Document what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered
5. **Surface open questions** - Identify unresolved issues, ambiguities, or areas needing clarification
6. **Map relationships** - Connect related concepts, files, and discussions across the codebase
7. **Provide comprehensive debrief** - Deliver a complete summary that brings everything together

Focus on:
- Current state of the codebase and recent changes
- Technical decisions and architectural choices
- Problem-solving approaches and solutions implemented
- Dependencies and relationships between components
- Open questions and areas requiring attention
- Project goals and progress toward them

Consider both:
- Explicit information (what was directly stated or coded)
- Implicit context (inferred patterns, conventions, and assumptions)

Format the debrief as:
- Structured summary with clear sections
- Key insights and takeaways
- Action items and next steps
- Questions that need answers
- Connections between different parts of the discussion

Bring all contexts into a unified understanding for the next phase of work.
