# codebase-search

Search and explore the codebase systematically to find code, patterns, and implementations related to a specific topic.

1. **Define search objective** - Clearly identify what code, patterns, or implementations you're looking for
2. **Plan search strategy** - Determine which search methods to use (semantic search, grep, file exploration, directory traversal)
3. **Execute searches** - Use codebase search tools, grep patterns, and file system exploration to find relevant code
4. **Review and filter results** - Examine search results, filter by relevance, and identify the most important findings
5. **Trace relationships** - Follow imports, references, and dependencies to understand how code connects
6. **Document findings** - Record file paths, line numbers, and key code snippets with context

Focus on:
- Code patterns and implementations
- Function and class definitions
- Configuration files and settings
- Documentation and comments
- File and directory structure
- Import and dependency relationships

Consider both:
- Exact matches (code that directly matches the search)
- Related code (code that solves similar problems or uses similar patterns)

Format search results as:
- Organized list of findings with file paths
- Relevant code snippets with line numbers
- Context about how code is used
- Relationships between files and components
- Clear references for further exploration

Conduct thorough codebase searches that efficiently locate relevant code and patterns.
