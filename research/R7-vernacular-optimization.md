# vernacular-optimization

Research and optimize command vernacular to prime agents for semantic goal trajectory. Analyze how language shapes thinking and execution, then propose improvements that lead thoughts to words to actions.

1. **Analyze current vernacular patterns** - Examine how commands express actions, focus areas, considerations, and formatting requirements. Identify linguistic structures that prime agents for execution.
2. **Identify semantic gaps** - Find where language is ambiguous, passive, or doesn't clearly guide action. Identify where vernacular doesn't match intended execution trajectory.
3. **Map language to mental models** - Understand how specific word choices shape agent understanding. Identify which phrases lead to better execution vs confusion.
4. **Propose action-oriented improvements** - Design language that explicitly guides thinking and execution. Ensure vernacular primes for the right actions.
5. **Validate semantic clarity** - Ensure proposed changes maintain clarity while improving action-priming. Test that new language leads to intended behaviors.

Focus on:
- Action verbs vs passive descriptions (e.g., "Execute" vs "Should be executed")
- Imperative mood for direct commands (e.g., "Identify" vs "Identification should occur")
- Specificity over generality (e.g., "Search codebase using grep" vs "Find code")
- Mental model priming (e.g., "Think systematically" vs "Consider options")
- Execution trajectory clarity (e.g., "First X, then Y, finally Z" vs "Do X, Y, Z")
- Semantic precision (e.g., "codebase-research" vs "research" for offline context)

Consider both:
- Current vernacular effectiveness (what works well)
- Potential improvements (what could be clearer, more action-oriented)

Format analysis as:
- Current pattern inventory with examples
- Semantic gap identification with before/after comparisons
- Mental model mapping (how language shapes understanding)
- Proposed improvements with rationale
- Validation criteria for vernacular changes

Research vernacular patterns that prime agents for optimal semantic goal trajectory through language that shapes thinking and guides execution.
