# git-commit-analyze-resume-trajectory

Commit current work, push to remote, then analyze git history to understand project trajectory and resume context.

1. **Stage all changes** - Review and stage all modified, new, and deleted files
2. **Create meaningful commit** - Write a clear commit message describing the changes
3. **Push to remote** - Push commits to the remote repository
4. **Analyze git trajectory** - Review commit history, branch structure, and project evolution
5. **Identify patterns** - Recognize development patterns, feature additions, and refactoring trends
6. **Extract context** - Understand the current state, recent work, and project direction
7. **Resume trajectory** - Use insights to continue work aligned with project goals

Focus on:
- Recent commit messages and their patterns
- Branch structure and merge history
- File change frequency and areas of active development
- Commit frequency and development velocity
- Major milestones or architectural changes
- Current branch state and uncommitted work

Consider both:
- Short-term trajectory (recent commits and immediate direction)
- Long-term trajectory (overall project evolution and patterns)

Format analysis as:
- Summary of recent activity and trends
- Key insights about project direction
- Recommendations for next steps
- Context needed to resume work effectively

Use git trajectory to understand where the project has been and where it's heading, then resume work accordingly.
