# web-search

Cite authoritative instructions and information from the web to support technical decisions and implementations.

1. **Identify information need** - Determine what authoritative information or instructions are required
2. **Structure search query** - Create comprehensive search queries that will find authoritative sources (documentation, official guides, best practices)
3. **Search and evaluate sources** - Use web search to find reliable sources, prioritizing official documentation and established authorities
4. **Extract relevant information** - Gather specific instructions, code examples, or technical details from authoritative sources
5. **Cite and apply** - Cite sources properly and apply the authoritative information to the current task

Focus on:
- Authoritative sources (official documentation, established best practices, recognized experts)
- Accurate citation of sources
- Relevant technical details and instructions
- Code examples and implementation patterns when applicable
- Verification of information accuracy

Consider both:
- Official documentation (most authoritative, but may be less practical)
- Community best practices (practical, but verify authority)

Format web search results as:
- Clear citations of authoritative sources
- Extracted relevant instructions or information
- Code examples or technical details when applicable
- Proper attribution to original sources

Provide authoritative information from the web that supports sound technical decisions and implementations.
