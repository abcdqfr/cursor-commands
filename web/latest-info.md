# latest-info

Research the latest information, updates, and current state of tools, libraries, frameworks, or technologies online.

1. **Identify information need** - Determine what latest information is required (version updates, new features, breaking changes, best practices)
2. **Search for official sources** - Find official documentation, release notes, changelogs, and project announcements
3. **Check recent updates** - Look for recent blog posts, GitHub releases, package manager updates, and community announcements
4. **Evaluate recency and relevance** - Assess how current the information is and whether it applies to your use case
5. **Synthesize latest information** - Combine findings from multiple sources to get a complete picture
6. **Document with timestamps** - Record findings with dates, versions, and source URLs for future reference

Focus on:
- Official release notes and changelogs
- Recent GitHub/GitLab releases and tags
- Package manager version information
- Official blog posts and announcements
- Community discussions about recent changes
- Breaking changes and migration guides
- Current best practices and recommendations

Consider both:
- Official sources (most authoritative, but may lag behind)
- Community sources (may be more current, but verify accuracy)

Format findings as:
- Summary of latest information with dates
- Version numbers and release dates
- Key changes and new features
- Breaking changes and migration notes
- Source URLs with timestamps
- Recommendations based on latest information

Provide up-to-date information from online sources with proper attribution and timestamps.
