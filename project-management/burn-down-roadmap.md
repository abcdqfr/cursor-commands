# burn-down-roadmap

Convert roadmap checkpoints into actionable todos and systematically complete them.

1. **Identify roadmap checkpoints** - Extract all milestones, features, or tasks from the roadmap
2. **Stage as todos** - Create structured todo items for each checkpoint with clear descriptions
3. **Prioritize by dependencies** - Order todos based on prerequisites and logical sequence
4. **Break down complex items** - Decompose large checkpoints into smaller, manageable tasks
5. **Execute systematically** - Work through todos one by one, marking complete as finished
6. **Track progress** - Update todo status and maintain visibility into remaining work

Focus on:
- Roadmap milestones and feature checkpoints
- Technical debt items that block progress
- Integration points between components
- Testing and validation requirements
- Documentation and deployment tasks

Consider both:
- Immediate blockers that prevent forward progress
- Long-term items that can be planned in parallel

Format todos with:
- Clear, actionable descriptions
- Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed)
- Dependencies or prerequisites where applicable
- Context about why each item matters

Burn through the list methodically, ensuring nothing is left incomplete.
