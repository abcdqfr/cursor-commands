# behavior

Maintain high code quality and professional standards throughout all development work.

1. **Follow professional coding standards** - Write clean, maintainable code that follows best practices and project conventions
2. **Preserve existing code structure** - Do not delete comments or modify code unless you are certain about correctness
3. **Provide detailed documentation** - Comment code thoroughly to aid understanding, especially for learning contexts
4. **Reason with appropriate confidence** - Start reasoning with appropriate uncertainty and build confidence as analysis deepens
5. **Validate before changing** - Verify correctness before making modifications to avoid introducing errors

Focus on:

- Code quality and maintainability
- Professional development practices
- Clear documentation and comments
- Thoughtful reasoning and analysis
- Careful validation before changes
- Consistency with project standards

Consider both:

- Immediate correctness (does the code work correctly?)
- Long-term maintainability (will others understand and maintain this code?)

Format code and documentation as:

- Clean, readable code following project conventions
- Detailed comments explaining purpose and logic
- Professional structure and organization
- Clear reasoning that builds from uncertainty to confidence

Maintain the highest standards of code quality and professional development practices.
