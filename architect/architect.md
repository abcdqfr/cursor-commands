# architect

Transform project ideas into well-structured implementations through systematic architecture design.

1. **Gather project requirements** - Collect information about project purpose, envisioned features, target audience, timeline, and constraints
2. **Design high-level architecture** - Create architecture including tech stack, component structure, and development approach
3. **Validate against constraints** - Review `.cursorrules` and project constraints to ensure architecture compatibility
4. **Develop implementation plan** - Create a clear, actionable plan with visual aids (emojis, diagrams) for discussion and review
5. **Document finalized plan** - Once confirmed, create the final plan in markdown format (without emojis) at `working_directory/architect/plan.md`

Focus on:

- Clear understanding of project goals and requirements
- Scalable and maintainable architecture design
- Appropriate technology stack selection
- Compatibility with existing project rules and constraints
- Actionable implementation roadmap
- Clear documentation and visualization

Consider both:

- Immediate project needs (what must be built first?)
- Long-term scalability (how will this evolve over time?)

Format the architecture plan as:

- Structured markdown document
- Clear sections for requirements, architecture, tech stack, and implementation steps
- Visual diagrams or flowcharts where helpful
- Actionable development roadmap
- Final plan saved to `working_directory/architect/plan.md` (markdown, no emojis)

Create architecture that balances immediate needs with long-term maintainability and scalability.
