# lint-file

Analyze the current file for linting issues and automatically fix them according to the project's coding standards, then apply the fixes directly to the code and explain what changes were made.

1. **Identify linting issues in current file** - Analyze the file for code formatting and style consistency, unused imports and variables, missing semicolons or proper indentation, best practice violations, and type safety issues
2. **Apply fixes to current file** - Fix formatting and style issues, remove unused imports and variables, add missing semicolons or correct indentation, apply best practice corrections, fix type safety issues, and explain what changes were made

Focus on:
- Single file scope (current file only)
- Code formatting and style consistency
- Unused imports and variables
- Missing semicolons or proper indentation
- Best practice violations
- Type safety issues
- Direct application of fixes to the file

Consider both:
- Project coding standards and conventions
- Language-specific best practices

Format the output as:
- List of issues identified in the current file
- Applied fixes with explanations
- Summary of changes made

Lint and fix the current file with precision and adherence to project standards.
