# debug

Perform root cause analysis with step-by-step investigation to identify and resolve issues systematically.

1. **Analyze potential causes** - Write detailed analysis (3 paragraphs minimum) exploring what the error might be, considering all possibilities without jumping to conclusions
2. **Challenge assumptions** - Quiet the ego and constantly challenge assumptions about what might be wrong
3. **Think broadly** - Consider that issues might require more context, or could be simple mistakes like missing packages or configuration typos
4. **Gather diagnostic information** - Collect error messages, logs, relevant code sections, and system state
5. **Test hypotheses systematically** - Formulate hypotheses and test them methodically to isolate the root cause
6. **Provide solution** - Once root cause is identified, propose and implement the fix

Focus on:
- Thorough analysis before conclusions
- Challenging assumptions and avoiding confirmation bias
- Considering simple causes (missing dependencies, typos, configuration errors)
- Systematic hypothesis testing
- Gathering complete diagnostic information
- Root cause identification, not just symptom treatment

Consider both:
- Obvious causes (common errors, missing dependencies, typos)
- Subtle causes (timing issues, state problems, edge cases)

Format the analysis as:
- At least 3 paragraphs exploring different possibilities
- Clear reasoning that doesn't jump to conclusions
- Systematic approach to hypothesis testing
- Complete diagnostic information gathering
- Root cause identification with clear solution path

Debug with thoroughness, humility, and systematic investigation to find the true root cause.
