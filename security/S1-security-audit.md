# security-audit

Comprehensive security review to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the codebase.

1. **Dependency audit** - Check for known vulnerabilities, update outdated packages, and review third-party dependencies
2. **Code security review** - Check for common vulnerabilities, review authentication/authorization, and audit data handling practices
3. **Infrastructure security** - Review environment variables, check access controls, and audit network security

Focus on:
- Dependency vulnerabilities and updates
- Common code vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data handling and protection
- Environment variable security
- Access controls and network security

Consider both:
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories)
- Potential vulnerabilities (code patterns, misconfigurations)

Format the output as:
- Dependency audit results with vulnerability details
- Code security findings with severity
- Infrastructure security assessment
- Remediation steps with priorities
- Security checklist completion status

Conduct comprehensive security audit with systematic vulnerability identification and remediation.
