## Separation of Concerns Analysis

### ✅ Well-Separated Concerns

- **Project Management** (burn-down-roadmap) - Isolated task execution
- **Code Analysis** (custom-imp-check) - Focused on technical debt
- **Documentation** (distill-to-volumes-md) - Dedicated to knowledge capture
- **Version Control** (git-commit-analyze-resume-trajectory) - Git-specific operations
- **Context Management** (round-table) - Information synthesis
- **Research** (summarize-and-search) - External information gathering

### ⚠️ Potential Overlaps

- **round-table** and **distill-to-volumes-md** both handle information synthesis
  - Separation: round-table = real-time debrief, distill = archival documentation
  - Status: Acceptable separation, but could be clearer

- **summarize-and-search** and **custom-imp-check** both involve analysis
  - Separation: summarize = external research, custom-imp = internal codebase analysis
  - Status: Well-separated

## Best Practices from Community

### Command Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each command does one thing well
2. **Clear Structure** - Follow the template format
3. **Actionable Steps** - Numbered, specific instructions
4. **Focus Areas** - Explicit scope definition
5. **Multiple Perspectives** - "Consider both" sections
6. **Format Specification** - Clear output expectations

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case: `command-name.md`
- Be descriptive: `generate-unit-tests.md` not `tests.md`
- Group by category in filename if flat structure: `code-review-checklist.md`

### Content Standards

- Start with clear purpose statement
- Include numbered steps (5-7 steps ideal)
- Define focus areas explicitly
- Specify output format
- Consider edge cases and constraints

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize** - Select 3-5 high-priority commands to implement first
2. **Implement** - Create new commands following the template
3. **Test** - Use commands in real scenarios and refine
4. **Organize** - Consider directory structure if collection grows
5. **Document** - Maintain this analysis document as commands evolve
6. **Community** - Share valuable commands back to community

# Offline vs Online Command Organization

**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Purpose:** Document the organization of commands into offline (codebase/index/documentation) and online (web/internet/latest) categories

## Directory Structure

### `research/` - Offline Codebase Research
Commands that work with local codebase, index, documentation, and project files.

- **`research.md`** - Conduct offline technical research using codebase, index, and documentation
- **`round-table.md`** - Synthesize contexts from open files, recent edits, project structure
- **`custom-imp-check.md`** - Analyze codebase to identify custom implementations
- **`battle-tested-solutions.md`** - Identify custom implementations in codebase (offline analysis)
- **`codebase-search.md`** - Search and explore codebase systematically

### `web/` - Online Web Research
Commands that use web search, internet sources, and latest online information.

- **`web-search.md`** - Cite authoritative instructions from the web
- **`research.md`** - Conduct online technical research using web search and internet sources
- **`summarize-and-search.md`** - Summarize intent and find answers from authoritative online sources
- **`battle-tested-solutions.md`** - Research mature alternatives online for custom implementations
- **`latest-info.md`** - Research latest information, updates, and current state online

## Command Variants

Some commands have both offline and online variants:

### Research
- **Offline:** `research/research.md` - Uses codebase, index, documentation
- **Online:** `web/research.md` - Uses web search, internet sources

### Battle-Tested Solutions
- **Offline:** `research/battle-tested-solutions.md` - Identifies custom implementations in codebase
- **Online:** `web/battle-tested-solutions.md` - Researches mature alternatives online

## Principles

1. **Never Delete** - Commands are moved, not deleted
2. **Never Copy** - Create variants in proper directories, don't duplicate
3. **Clear Separation** - Offline commands in `research/`, online commands in `web/`
4. **Proper Organization** - Maintain directory structure and naming conventions
5. **Variant Creation** - When a command needs both offline/online capabilities, create variants in appropriate directories

## Usage Guidelines

### When to use `research/` commands:
- Searching codebase
- Analyzing project structure
- Reviewing local documentation
- Finding patterns in existing code
- Understanding project conventions

### When to use `web/` commands:
- Finding latest information
- Researching external tools/libraries
- Looking up official documentation online
- Finding community solutions
- Getting current best practices

## Migration History

- `summary/summarize-and-search.md` → `web/summarize-and-search.md` (moved - explicitly uses online sources)
- `research/research.md` → Split into offline (`research/research.md`) and online (`web/research.md`) variants
- `research/battle-tested-solutions.md` → Split into offline (`research/battle-tested-solutions.md`) and online (`web/battle-tested-solutions.md`) variants

## New Commands Created

- `research/codebase-search.md` - Systematic codebase search and exploration
- `web/latest-info.md` - Research latest information and updates online

# Command Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ All enhancements completed

## Overview

Completed comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of all weak links in the command arsenal to match best-in-class examples. All commands now follow consistent structure and standards.

## Enhancements Completed

### 1. Created Missing Command

- **`research/battle-tested-solutions.md`** - Created comprehensive command from scratch following the gold standard structure

### 2. Enhanced Critical Commands (5 files)

- **`behavior/behavior.md`** - Transformed from bullet list to structured command with numbered steps, Focus on, Consider both, and Format sections
- **`architect/architect.md`** - Enhanced to comprehensive structure matching best examples
- **`summary/summary.md`** - Enhanced to match `round-table.md` structure with numbered steps
- **`research/research.md`** - Expanded from single bullet to comprehensive research command
- **`debug/debug.md`** - Enhanced to match `debug-issue.md` structure with systematic approach

### 3. Enhanced Additional Commands (2 files)

- **`web/web-search.md`** - Transformed from 2-line stub to comprehensive web search command
- **`code-quality/deslop.md`** - Enhanced from minimal structure to full command with numbered steps

## Standards Applied

All enhanced commands now include:

- ✅ Clear title with `# command-name`
- ✅ Brief description
- ✅ Numbered steps (1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ "Focus on:" section with bullet points
- ✅ "Consider both:" section
- ✅ "Format" section or equivalent
- ✅ Consistent structure matching best examples

## Quality Improvements

### Before

- Inconsistent formats (bullet lists, minimal text, no structure)
- Missing key sections (Focus on, Consider both, Format)
- Unclear execution instructions
- Inconsistent with template

### After

- Consistent structure across all commands
- Complete sections following template
- Clear, actionable numbered steps
- Professional formatting matching gold standards

## Files Enhanced

1. `research/battle-tested-solutions.md` (created)
2. `behavior/behavior.md` (enhanced)
3. `architect/architect.md` (enhanced)
4. `summary/summary.md` (enhanced)
5. `research/research.md` (enhanced)
6. `debug/debug.md` (enhanced)
7. `web/web-search.md` (enhanced)
8. `code-quality/deslop.md` (enhanced)

## Verification

All commands now:

- Follow the `COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md` structure
- Match the quality of best examples (`round-table.md`, `create-spec-repo.md`, `code-review.md`)
- Are executable verbatim without interpretation
- Include all required sections
- Maintain consistency across the arsenal

## Next Steps

- All weak links have been addressed
- Command arsenal is now consistent and maintainable
- Future commands should follow the established template
- Regular reviews recommended to maintain standards
