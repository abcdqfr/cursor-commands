# create-pr

Create a well-structured pull request with proper description, labels, and reviewers.

1. **Prepare branch** - Ensure all changes are committed, push branch to remote, and verify branch is up to date with main
2. **Write PR description** - Summarize changes clearly, include context and motivation, list any breaking changes, and add screenshots if UI changes
3. **Set up PR** - Create PR with descriptive title, add appropriate labels, assign reviewers, and link related issues

Focus on:
- Branch preparation and synchronization
- Clear PR description with context
- Breaking changes documentation
- Appropriate labels and reviewers
- Issue linking

Consider both:
- PR content (description, context, motivation)
- PR metadata (labels, reviewers, issues)

Format the output as:
- PR title suggestion
- PR description template
- Label recommendations
- Reviewer suggestions
- Issue links

Create well-structured pull request with comprehensive description and proper metadata.
