# distill-to-volumes-md

Transform the entire conversation into well-organized, polished markdown volumes that capture all context and insights.

1. **Analyze conversation structure** - Review the full conversation from start to finish, identifying themes and topics
2. **Categorize into logical volumes** - Group related discussions, decisions, and code into coherent volumes
3. **Number volumes sequentially** - Assign volume numbers that reflect logical flow and dependencies
4. **Extract and preserve all content** - Include every relevant excerpt, code snippet, decision, and insight
5. **Refactor and polish** - Improve clarity, add structure, fix formatting, and enhance readability
6. **Add contextual additions** - Include any necessary explanations, cross-references, or supplementary information
7. **Ensure completeness** - Verify no important information is left out or scattered across volumes

Focus on:
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Code implementations and architecture patterns
- Problem-solving approaches and solutions
- Requirements and constraints
- Future considerations and open questions
- All code changes and file modifications

Consider both:
- Chronological flow of the conversation
- Logical grouping by topic or domain

Format each volume as:
- Self-contained markdown documents
- Clear headings and structure
- Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Cross-references between related volumes
- Numbered volumes (e.g., VOLUME_01_*.md, VOLUME_02_*.md)

Each volume should be comprehensive enough to stand alone while being part of a cohesive documentation set. No scrap of valuable information should remain outside the codebase.
