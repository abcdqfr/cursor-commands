# masterclass

Provide a comprehensive masterclass on any tool, technology, concept, or framework. This is a generic, reusable command that works for any topic.

1. **Identify the topic** - Determine what tool, technology, concept, or framework needs a masterclass. What is the user trying to learn or understand deeply?
2. **Research fundamentals** - Find core concepts, architecture, design principles, and foundational knowledge. What are the essential building blocks?
3. **Explore features and capabilities** - Identify key features, use cases, and what problems it solves. What can it do and when should it be used?
4. **Examine best practices** - Research established patterns, conventions, and recommended approaches. How do experts use it?
5. **Analyze integration patterns** - Understand how it integrates with other tools, workflows, and ecosystems. Where does it fit?
6. **Document practical examples** - Provide real-world usage examples, code snippets, and common patterns. How is it actually used?
7. **Cover advanced topics** - Explore advanced features, edge cases, and expert-level techniques. What do power users need to know?
8. **Provide learning path** - Outline a structured learning progression from beginner to advanced. How should someone learn this?

Focus on:
- Core concepts and architecture
- Key features and capabilities
- Best practices and patterns
- Integration with other tools
- Real-world usage examples
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Advanced techniques and optimizations
- Official documentation and authoritative sources
- Community resources and learning materials
- Tooling and ecosystem (linters, formatters, IDEs, etc.)

Consider both:
- Official documentation (authoritative, but may be dry)
- Community knowledge (practical, but verify accuracy)
- Beginner needs (fundamentals, getting started)
- Advanced needs (optimization, edge cases, expert patterns)

Format the masterclass as:
- **Overview**: What is it and why does it matter?
- **Core Concepts**: Essential building blocks
- **Key Features**: What it can do
- **Best Practices**: Recommended patterns and conventions
- **Integration**: How it fits into workflows
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world usage
- **Advanced Topics**: Expert-level techniques
- **Learning Resources**: Official docs, tutorials, community
- **Tooling**: Linters, formatters, IDE support, etc.
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid and why

Provide a comprehensive, structured masterclass that serves as both a learning resource and a reference guide, applicable to any tool, technology, or concept.
