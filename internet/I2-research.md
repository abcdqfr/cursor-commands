# research

Conduct efficient online technical research using web search, internet sources, and latest information.

1. **Define research objective** - Clearly identify what information, solution, or understanding is needed from online sources
2. **Structure web search queries** - Create comprehensive search queries that include all relevant context and technical requirements
3. **Search authoritative online sources** - Find official documentation, examples, code snippets, and technical details from reliable web sources
4. **Evaluate source quality** - Assess credibility, recency, and relevance of online information
5. **Analyze and synthesize** - Evaluate gathered information and synthesize findings into actionable insights
6. **Document findings with citations** - Record research results, web sources, URLs, and recommendations for future reference

Focus on:
- Official documentation and authoritative sources
- Latest tools, libraries, and frameworks
- Current best practices and industry standards
- Community solutions and examples
- Recent updates and version information
- Web-based code examples and tutorials

Consider both:
- Direct answers (what exactly solves the problem from online sources?)
- Related patterns (what similar problems have been solved online and how?)

Format research queries as:
- Clear, comprehensive paragraphs that command a researcher to find specific information online
- Include all relevant context and technical requirements
- Request code snippets or technical details when relevant
- Structure as if instructing a human researcher to search the web

Format research findings as:
- Synthesized insights with clear recommendations
- Web source citations with URLs
- Code examples or technical details from online sources
- Actionable next steps with source attribution

Conduct research that efficiently finds authoritative answers from the web and provides actionable solutions with proper source attribution.
