# research-strategy

Summarize the user's intent, reframe the question for optimal research, and find the best answers from authoritative online sources. Focus on understanding what the user really wants and optimizing the research approach.

1. **Understand the core desire** - Identify what the user is trying to achieve or learn, beyond the surface-level question
2. **Recap the question** - Summarize the original question or request in clear terms to ensure understanding
3. **Rephrase for research** - Reframe the question using better keywords, terminology, and search strategies to optimize search effectiveness
4. **Identify underlying questions** - Uncover related questions that need answering for a complete solution
5. **Search authoritative sources** - Query online sources using optimized search terms, using the `web_search` tool with the refined queries
6. **Evaluate and synthesize** - Assess source quality and combine the best information from multiple sources
7. **Present comprehensive answers** - Deliver well-structured responses that address the core question and related concerns with proper citations

Focus on:
- The user's primary goal or problem to solve (intent understanding)
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Industry best practices and established solutions
- Current tools, libraries, or frameworks that address the need
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Trade-offs and considerations for different approaches
- Research strategy optimization

Consider both:
- Direct answers to the stated question
- Related information that provides broader context

Format the response as:
- Clear summary of the user's intent
- Rephrased question(s) for optimal research
- Comprehensive answers from authoritative sources with URLs
- Multiple perspectives or approaches where relevant
- Actionable recommendations with source citations

Transform the original question into a research strategy that yields the best possible answers through intent analysis and query optimization.
